I just started learning React on scrimba.com so this is how I did the Solo Project 2:
- Make a simple travel journal that looks like this https://www.figma.com/file/QG4cOExkdbIbhSfWJhs2gs/Travel-Journal?node-id=0%3A1
- Get info from a separate data file
- use .map() and props
- I made it pretty responsive
- there is max-width: 550px because that's the width in figma, didn't know what else to put, didn't want it to stretch too much tho.
Code works perfectly in Scrimba environment when the dependencies are: react-dom@18.2.0 react@18.2.0
Also works perfectly in VS Code where react and react-dom are 18.1.0
- didn't know how to get that specific icon from figma lol so I just used a sample icon URL that looks similar
- i don't even know how git works lol total noob
